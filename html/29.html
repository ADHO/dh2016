They might also be the only resolve for future education and rebuilding efforts once the wars in Syria, Iraq or Yemen come to an end; and while the digitisation of Archaelogical artefacts has recently received some attention from well-funded international and national organisations, particularly vulnerable collections of texts in libraries, archives, and private homes are destroyed without the world having known about their existence in the first place. <span id="ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="For a good example of crowd-sourced conservation efforts targetted at the Armenian communities of the Ottoman Empire see the Houshamadyan project, whi…" href="#ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>Early Arabic periodicals, such as Butrus al-Bustānī’s <span style="font-style:italic">al-Jinān</span> (Beirut, 1876–86), Yaʿqūb Ṣarrūf, Fāris Nimr, and Shāhīn Makāriyūs’ <span style="font-style:italic">al-Muqtaṭaf</span> (Beirut and Cairo, 1876–1952), Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī’s <span style="font-style:italic">al-Muqtabas</span> (Cairo and Damascus, 1906–18/19) or Rashīd Riḍā’s <span style="font-style:italic">al-Manār</span> (Cairo, 1898–1941) are at the core of the Arabic renaissance ( <span style="font-style:italic">al-nahḍa</span>), Arab nationalism, and the Islamic reform movement. These better known and—at the time—widely popular journals do not face the ultimate danger of their last copy being destroyed. Yet, copies are distributed throughout libraries and institutions worldwide. This makes it almost impossible to trace discourses across journals and with the demolition and closure of libraries in the Middle East, they are increasingly accessible to the affluent Western researcher only. <span id="ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="In many instances libraries hold incomplete collections and only single copies. This, for instance, has caused even scholars working on individual jou…" href="#ftn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>Digitisation seemingly offers an “easy” remedy to the problem of access and some large-scale scanning projects, such as <a class="link_ref" href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/">Hathitrust</a>, <span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="It must be noted that the US-based HathiTrust does not provide public or open access to its collections even to material deemed in the public domain u…" href="#ftn3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> the <a class="link_ref" href="http://eap.bl.uk/">British Library’s “Endangered Archives Programme” (EAP)</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/">MenaDoc</a> or <a class="link_ref" href="http://ima.bibalex.org/IMA/presentation/home/list.jsf">Institut du Monde Arabe</a> produced digital facsimiles of numerous Arabic periodicals. But due to the state of Arabic OCR and the particular difficulties of low-quality fonts, inks, and paper employed at the turn of the twentieth century, these texts can only reliably be digitised by human transcription (c.f. Märgner and El Abed, 2012). <span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="For the abominable state of Arabic OCR even for well-funded corporations and projects, try searching inside Arabic works on Google Books or HathiTrust…" href="#ftn4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Funds for transcribing the tens to hundreds of thousands of pages of an average mundane periodical are simply not available, despite of their cultural significance and unlike for valuable manuscripts and high-brow literature. Consequently, we still have not a single digital scholarly edition of any of these journals.</p><p>On the other hand, gray online-libraries of Arabic literature, namely <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.shamela.ws/"><span style="font-style:italic">al-Maktaba al-Shāmila</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://almeshkat.net/"><span style="font-style:italic">Mishkāt</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://saaid.net/"><span style="font-style:italic">Ṣayd al-Fawāʾid</span></a> or <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.alwaraq.net/"><span style="font-style:italic">al-Waraq</span></a>, provide access to a vast body of, mostly classical, Arabic texts including transcriptions of unknown provenance, editorial principals, and quality for some of the mentioned periodicals. In addition, these gray “editions” lack information linking the digital representation to material originals, namely bibliographic meta-data and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to employ for scholarly research.</p></div><div class="DH-Heading1" id="our-proposed-solution"><h2 class="DH-Heading1"><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Our proposed solution</span></h2><p>With the <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas">GitHub-hosted TEI edition of <span style="font-style:italic">Majallat al-Muqtabas</span></a> <span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="For a history of Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī’s journal al-Muqtabas (The Digest) see (Seikaly, 1981) and the readme.md of the project’s GitHub repository." href="#ftn5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> we want to show that through re-purposing well-established open software and by bridging the gap between immensely popular, but non-academic (and, at least under US copyright laws, occasionally illegal) online libraries of volunteers and academic scanning efforts as well as editorial expertise, one can produce scholarly editions that offer solutions for most of the above-mentioned problems—including the absence of expensive infrastructure: We use <a class="link_ref" href="http://shamela.ws/index.php/book/26523">digital texts from <span style="font-style:italic">shamela.ws</span></a>, transform them into TEI XML, add light structural mark-up for articles, sections, authors, and bibliographic metadata, and link each page to facsimiles provided through <a class="link_ref" href="http://eap.bl.uk/database/overview_project.a4d?projID=EAP119;r=63">EAP</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100658549">HathiTrust</a>; the latter step, in the process of which we also make first corrections to the transcription, though trivial, is the most labour-intensive, given that page breaks are commonly ignored by <span style="font-style:italic">shamela.</span>ws’s anonymous transcribers. The digital edition (TEI, markdown, and a web-display) is then hosted as a GitHub repository with a <a class="link_ref" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0 licence</a> for reading, contribution, and re-use. <span id="ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="The text of al-Muqtabas itself is in the public domain even under the most restrictive definitions (i.e. in the USA); the anonymous original transcrib…" href="#ftn6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p>We argue that by linking facsimiles to the digital text, every reader can validate the quality of the transcription against the original we can remove the greatest limitation of crowd-sourced or gray transcriptions and the main source of disciplinary contempt among historians and scholars of the Middle East. Improvements of the transcription and mark-up can be crowd-sourced with clear attribution of authorship and version control using .git and GitHub’s core functionality. Such an approach as proposed by Christian Wittern (2013) has recently seen a number of concurrent practical implementations such as project <a class="link_ref" href="https://gitenberg.github.io/">GITenberg</a> led by Seth Woodworth, Jonathan Reeve’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/Git-Lit/git-lit">Git-lit</a>, and others.</p><p>In addition to the TEI XML files we provide structured bibliographic metadata for every article in <span style="font-style:italic">al-Muqtabas</span> (currently as BibTeX). The TEI edition will be referencable down to the word level for scholarly citations, annotation layers, as well as web-applications through a documented and persistent URI scheme.</p><p>In order to contribute to the improvement of Arabic OCR algorithms, we will provide corrected transcriptions of the facsimile pages as ground truth to interested research projects starting with <a class="link_ref" href="https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/">transkribus.eu</a>.</p><p>To ease access for human readers (the main projected audience of our edition) and the correction process, we also provide a <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/tillgrallert/tei-boilerplate-arabic-editions">basic web-display</a> that adheres to the principles of <a class="link_ref" href="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp">GO::DH’s Minimal Computing Working group</a>. This web-display is implemented through an adaptation of the <a class="link_ref" href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/">TEI Boilerplate XSLT stylesheets</a> to the needs of Arabic texts and the parallel display of facsimiles and the transcription. Based solely on XSLT 1 and CSS, it runs in most internet browsers and can be downloaded, distributed and run locally without any internet connection—an absolute necessity for societies outside the global North.</p><div class="panel panel-default panel-figure"><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/data/559/image1.png" alt="Figure 1: The web-display of &#xA;                         based on TEI Boilerplate.&#xA;                    " class="inline" /><div class="caption">Figure 1: The web-display of <span style="font-style:italic">Digital Muqtabas</span> based on TEI Boilerplate.</div></div><p>Finally, by sharing all our code, we hope to facilitate similar projects and digital editions of further periodicals.

We will propose a solution to some of these problems based on the principles of openness, simplicity, and adherence to scholarly and technical standards. Applying these principles, our edition of <span style="font-style:italic">Majallat al-Muqtabas</span> improves already existing digital artefacts and makes them accessible for reading and re-use to the scholarly community as well as the general public. Finally, we will discuss the particular challenges and experiences of this still very young project (since October 2015).</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="bibliogr" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber"> </span></h2><div class="listhead">Bibliography</div><ol class="listBibl"><li id="index.xml-bibl-d30e427"><div class="Bibliography"><span style="font-weight:bold">Commins, D.</span> (1990). <span style="font-style:italic">Islamic Reform: Politics and Social Change in Late Ottoman Syria</span>.
